INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THIS SOFTWARE

Make sure that you are on the ENGR server. If you are working directly on an ENGR machine, things will work more smoothly
than if you are using a mobaXterm or something. Since our webpage isn't public (we don't have a domain), it requires you
to open a webpage directly on the ENGR machine in order to see our server content.


If you want to execute everything [IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO GRADE OUR PROJECT, DO THIS]
Type:
	chmod +x openweb
	./openweb 
	You can type
		./openweb back
	to start the server process in the background if you want to do other things in the terminal.
	Type Ctrl C to kill the server process (this only works if it is in the foreground)
	Type fg to move the server process into the foreground. (As long as nothing else is working in the background)


To test our back-end code, type: node test.js    
To run our server, type: node server.js  
  
If you want to open up the browser on the ENGR machine, type google-chrome [page-name].


SMALL ISSUES YOU MIGHT RUN INTO

If you get an ERR:EADDRINUSE error, then you already have an instance of the server on that port.
Type Ctrl C to kill a server running on the foreground.
Type fg to move a process running on the background into the foreground.

Type ps to see the PID of the process (the CMD will be called node)
Type kill -9 [PID of node] to kill the process.
